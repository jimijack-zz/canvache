The idea behind canvaché was to provide a site where artists can log in, designate their preferred area or location by zip code and then follow local galleries in their area.

Gallery reps could also use canvaché to post information on their upcoming artist openings or various other events.  

Artist can then favorite galleries, set up alerts to notify them of upcoming events from their favorite galleries, or just browse their area for new galleries to visit.

Ultimately the goal is for it to be a faster way to connect artists and galleries with a streamlined app that will expedite that search, broaden the artist network, and hopefully connect them with more opportunity for their own potential.
